#! Advanced Placement Computer Science A -- Unit 1 Challenge Instructions v0.99 !#

This challenge requires an understanding of the Java topics learned in Unit 1.

There are two scenarios described below.  
Choose one of them to complete.
You can complete both for extra credit.  

Write a Java program that will complete the task described in the scenario. 

Use the Unit1Challenge.java file to write your code.  
Rename it to match the class requirement for each scenario.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Scenario 1 -- Financial Programming -- Calculating Loans
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Write a program to calculate the monthly simple interest on a savings account.
Use the following formula for simple interest:

I = Prt 

In this forumla the variables represent the following values: 
I = interest
P = principal (opening balance)
r = rate of interest per year (as a decimal)
t = time (convert 1 month to into years as a decimal)

The program should do the following: 
-- Ask the user for a 12 digit account number.  
-- Ask the user for the name of the account owner.
-- Ask the user for the opening balance of the correct account number. 
-- Ask the user for the yearly interest rate percentage but exclude the % symbol.
-- Convert the interest rate percentage to a decimal.  
-- Calculate the simple monthly interest on the account balance. 
-- Add the interest to the opening account balance. 
-- Display a message indicating the opening balance and the account number.
-- Display a message indicating the amount of interest earned and the new balance.
-- Display a message thanking the owner for their business. 

The program has the following requirements:
-- Class Name: SavingsCalculator
-- There should be at least one empty line between user input and the next question. 
-- Minimum of 10 separate commits with version numbers and summary / descriptions.


There are two examples of correct program output below to help guide you. 

Example Output 0:

Please type the 12-digit account number:
0123456789012

What is the name of the account owner?
Charles Barles

Enter the opening balance for Account #0123456789012.  Do not include $ or , please:
123542.45

Enter the current interest rate in percentage format.  Do not include the % please:
1.23
